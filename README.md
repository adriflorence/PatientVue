# Patient Vue

### Data Source
PatientVue uses the [Patient View API](https://patientviewbasic.docs.apiary.io), a set of JSON-based REST endpoints that allow retrieval of a patient's hospital records.

### Vue application

The client was created from scratch with the help of [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org).
